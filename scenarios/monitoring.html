							<h1 class="major">My partner is monitoring my computer or cell phone activity.</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>So much of our safety and happiness comes from our computers and cell phones. We stay in touch with friends and family through emails, text messages, and social media. We browse job opportunities, or pursue our education. We learn about the world around us and engage in our favorite hobbies. <b>Our computers and cell phones are private spaces where we are free to be ourselves as we need to be.</b></p>
							<p>Abusive men often try to monitor women's computer activity, with or without consent. An abuser may ask their partner for passwords to personal accounts or devices, claiming that openness is important for the relationship. He might check web browser history, text messages, or photos, claiming that he's "just curious". In more extreme cases, an abuser will secretly install software that records keyboard strokes or emails. In each of these scenarios, <b>surveillance is a tactic to control a partner</b>. In healthy relationships, sharing digital activity can be embraced by each partner with mutual respect for privacy, autonomy, and boundaries. In contrast, abusive partners are driven by suspicion, jealousy, insecurity, revenge, or hatred.</p>
							<p>Being monitored by an abuser can create feelings of fear, anxiety, or hopelessness. A woman may worry that visiting a certain website or emailing a friend could upset her partner, so she'll avoid those activities to reduce the possibility of conflict. A woman seeking support may want to call a domestic violence organization for help, but is afraid that her partner will find out and punish her. Even after an abusive relationship has ended, a woman may still feel that her ex-partner is watching her, triggering her trauma.</p>
							<p><b>By taking measures to reduce computer and cell phone monitoring, a survivor can protect themselves from abusive partners, connect to support networks, and exert their independence.</b> Many survivors are unsure whether they're being monitored, so first we'll walk through "red flags" that may indicate surveillance. Then, we'll discuss defense strategies based on personal levels of comfort and safety.</p>
							<h2>Red Flags</h2>
							<p>Computer and cell phone monitoring can be obvious or secret. It can be consensual or non-consensual. Some abusers may choose to act on their collected information, while others will choose not to discuss it. Here are some red flags that may indicate that your activity is being monitored.</p>
							<ul>
							 <li>Your partner frequently asks to see your device, or takes it.</li>
							 <li>Your partner demands passwords to your devices.</li>
							 <li>Your partner wants login information for your email, banking, shopping, or social media accounts.</li>
							 <li>Your partner is known to be "good with computers" and handles your computer tasks.</li>
							 <li>Your partner spends a significant amount of time on their computer and is unusually secretive about it.</li>
							 <li>Your partner makes vague references to activities or conversations they were not present for.</li>
							 <li>Your partner gets unexpectedly angry towards a person you've recently communicated with.</li>
							 <li>Your partner makes threats to reveal embarrassing information about you.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Defense Strategies</h2>
							<p>Computers and cell phones are very complex devices, even for experienced technology professionals. It can be difficult to know if you're being monitored. It can feel intimidating to download unfamiliar software or change the settings in existing software. You might also be afraid of your partner catching you changing your computer or cell phone. It's okay to feel this way. <b>You don't need to be a professional programmer to secure your devices.</b> With the following strategies, you can decide for yourself whether you feel safe enough and comfortable enough to attempt a certain strategy. You don't have to do them all at once. You're not obliged to take action if you don't want to: <em>just being aware of surveillance gives you strength.</em></p>
							<h3>Change your passwords</h3>
							<p>If you suspect your partner is reading your emails, accessing your texts, looking at your photos, or using your device, you can change your passwords to lock them out. If you are physically separated from your partner, you should change all of the passwords to your most important devices and online accounts, even if you're unsure if they've been compromised. One option is to use the use the PASSWORD MANAGER strategy: a password manager generates and stores passwords for you, so you do not have to remember them. This makes it harder for a partner to guess your password or hack into your account. You can also use the TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION strategy: when you login to an important account, you need a code generated by your phone or received in a text. Even if a partner has your password, they would still need your cell phone in order to access your account.</p>
							<p>If your partner has physical access to your computer or cell phone, changing passwords depends on your safety levels. If you think your partner would become violent or hurtful by losing access to your devices or accounts, you do not have to change your passwords. If you're unsure whether you're being monitored, try changing one password and waiting a few days to see if they react. If they do not react, try changing another password and repeat the process.</p>
							<p>If your partner asks you why you are changing passwords, you can say that you're worried about being hacked. Hacking is very common in the news, so pointing to a recent hacking story may help. You can also say that you're interested in cybersecurity as a result of NSA surveillance: many men are interested in cybersecurity and would share this interest.</p>
							<h3>Protect your computer web browsing</h3>
							<p>Web browsers store every website you visit in their "history". Abusers with access to your web browser can check this history to see which websites you've visited and when. Web browsers also store "cookies", pieces of data used by websites to store login information, website settings, or advertising data. Cookies allow you to return to websites after you've logged-in and still use your account. If this login cookie is stored, an abuser can easily access your account.</p>
							<p>Computer web browsers offer options for handling web history and cookies. If you feel comfortable altering your web browser's settings, you can use the DELETE YOUR HISTORY strategy to automatically erase your history and cookies. If you do not feel comfortable altering your web browser's settings, you can delete individual cookies and history records in the steps outlined below. Different versions of web browsers may have different menus or options, so if a process does not work for you, try exploring the web browser for menus with words like "Privacy Settings", Content Settings", "Preferences", "History", and "Cookies".</p>
							<p>You can also choose to browse in a "Private Window" in Firefox, an "Incognito Window" in Chrome, and a "Private Window" in Safari. These browser windows will automatically delete the website records or cookies from your browsing session. This is an easy and effective strategy for when you want to browse the web without a trace.</p>
							<h4>Firefox</h4>
							Deleting history:
							<ol>
								<li>Click the "History" tab</li>
								<li>Click "Show All History"</li>
								<li>Select the website record you want to delete</li>
								<li>Right-click and select "Delete This Page". You can also choose to delete specific periods of time.</li></p>
							</ol>
							Deleting cookies:
							<ol>
								<li>Click the "Firefox" tab</li>
								<li>Select "Preferences"</li>
								<li>Select the "Privacy Menu"</li>
								<li>Click "Show Cookies"</li>
								<li>Search for the website to delete, select it, and click "Remove Selected"</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Chrome</h4>
							Deleting history and cookies:
							<ol>
								<li>Click the "Chrome" tab</li>
								<li>Click "Preferences"</li>
								<li>Click "Show Advanced Settings"</li>
								<li>Click "Clear Browsing Data"</li>
								<li>Check the options you want to delete</li>
								<li>Select the period of time you want to delete</li>
								<li>Finally click "Clear Browsing Data"</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Safari</h4>
							Deleting history and cookies:
							<ol>
								<li>Click the "Safari" tab</li>
								<li>Click "Clear History..."</li>
								<li>Select the time period you want to delete</li>
								<li>Click "Clear History".</li>
							</ol>
							<h3>Protect your cell phone apps</h3>
							<p>If your partner has physical access to your cell phone, they may be monitoring your activity by using your apps. They may also download malicious apps that monitor other apps. If you feel comfortable changing your phone, you should delete any apps that you have not personally downloaded. For the apps you do use, check your phone's settings to see what each app is allowed to use. App data such as location or photos can unknowingly reveal very personal information to an abuser with access to the app or the app's account. Disable access to photos, cameras, location, microphones, and other apps unless they're absolutely necessary for a given app. For example, it makes sense for a photo app to have access to a camera. A calendar app may ask for location, which is not as important.</p>
							<p>Many apps will store your data in "the cloud", meaning that it's backed up on a company's servers. If you are concerned your partner has access to an app that uses the cloud, please read our "My abuser has access to my cloud" guide.</p>
							<p>If you are not comfortable changing your phone, there are ways to use your apps more secretly. In Safari and Chrome, you can choose to browse in a "Private Window" or "Incognito Window", which does not store web history or cookies that could be exploited by an abuser. In your texting apps, you can delete conversations (though you can only delete the entire conversation). For phone calls, you can delete call history. For contacts, you can give people and organizations fake names when you store their phone number. Make sure to close apps when you're not using them, so that they do not record your activity.</p>
							<h3>Install Malware Protection</h3>
							<p>Malware is malicious software installed on your computer without your consent. Some abusers secretly install "Keylogging" malware in order to monitor keyboard strokes on your computer. This allows them to collect passwords, emails, texts, and anything else you type on a computer. Other kinds of malware can track your web browsing history or email software. Some software offers privacy controls for parents to monitor their children's activity: abusers will use these controls to monitor you instead.</p>
							<p>Because there are so many kinds of malware, it's often difficult to detect them. If you think you may be monitored by malware, a great strategy is to INSTALL MALWARE PROTECTION. This program will scan your computer and alert you to programs that might be malicious. You can then choose to delete them or leave them be. The program is not 100% accurate, however, so even if the program does not find malware, it's not a guarantee that your computer is safe. Malware protection is also much more effective on computers than cell phones, so if you're worried about malware on your cell phone, malware protection is not the best strategy. In these cases, you should consider the other strategies on this page.</p>
							<p>Malware protection is very common, especially on Windows computers, so if a partner asks why you are using malware protection, you can say that it's to protect against viruses. You can also delete the Malware protection after you've used it.</p>
							<h3>Refresh your operating system</h3>
							<p>If you want to ensure that your computer or cell phone does not have surveillance malware or apps installed, or if you know you are actively being monitored, you can refresh your device's operating system. This means treating your computer or cell phone as a brand new device: all of your applications, data, and settings will be erased. Every operating system has a different way of refreshing, so we will provide links to current instructions for Mac OS and Windows.</p>
							<p>~INSERT LINKS HERE~</p>
							<p>When you decide to refresh your device, make sure any important data is backed up in the cloud or on an external hard drive. If you are concerned that your partner would have access to your cloud, please read our "My abuser has access to my cloud" guide.</p>
							<h3>Use a work computer, a library computer, or buy a secret computer/cell phone</h3>
							<p>Many people have a computer they use for work, either at their office or at home. Some abusers may be less willing to monitor a work computer, either because they do not have access to your office, or they don't want to catch the attention of an IT worker. Using the work computer for sensitive activity like researching domestic violence resources or contacting loved ones may be an option for you. When using a personal account on the work computer, like an email account, be aware that your abuser may have access to this account and could be monitoring it from their own computer.</p>
							<p>Libraries are equipped with computers and helpful librarians. If you need a safe space to use the internet, libraries are a free and accessible option. Librarians would also be more than happy to assist you in web research or technical questions.</p>
							<p>If you have financial resources and physical freedom, you can consider purchasing a "secret" laptop or phone to use. You could use these devices for sensitive activity that might be dangerous on a device your partner has access to. We would only recommend this approach if you feel safe enough to keep property safe from your abuser.</p>
							<h3>Create secret accounts</h3>
							<p>When you don't have the option of securing your personal accounts, such as your email account, you can secretly create new accounts that your abuser is unaware of.  When you register online, make sure to use a totally new password that your abuser would not be able to guess. Also make sure you use an email address and/or login name that your abuser is unfamiliar with. If you think your abuser may be monitoring your web history, use a private window for the entire browsing session. If you think your abuse has installed surveillance software, or may intrude on your web browsing session, consider making your secret accounts on a work or library computer.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>You have a right to privacy on your computer and cell phone. Computer and cell phone monitoring is a deeply invasive tactic meant to instill fear and anxiety in a partner while establishing control. By considering your personal passwords, your web browsing history and cookies, malware detection software, and alternative means of internet access, you are giving yourself a wealth of strategies for resisting a controlling partner and asserting your personal autonomy.</p>
							<p>If you're unsure of the right strategy for you, please contact a domestic violence organization for further assistance.</p>
