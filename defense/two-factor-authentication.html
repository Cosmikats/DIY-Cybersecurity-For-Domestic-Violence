							<p>What do you do when your passwords are compromised? Whether your partner knows your passwords or a website has been hacked, it's best to have a safety-net on your email, social media, and password manager accounts. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a simple step added to the login process: after you enter a password, you have to enter a numeric token like 653 234 or 4327. This token is either sent to you through text or is generated by a Two-Factor Authentication app. The token is only valid for a few moments—if someone tried to re-use an old token, it wouldn't work. By enabling Two-Factor Authentication on participating websites, you add an extra layer of security to your online accounts.</p>
							<p>Two-Factor Authentication depends on your phone being secure. If your partner can use your phone (maybe they demand access, maybe you don't have a password on your phone), then Two-Factor Authentication won't guarantee total protection. That said, it's still a significant deterrent to hackers, so it's worth enabling if you feel safe to do so. All you have to do is go to your website, check the settings for Two-Factor Authentication, and walk through the provided steps. Most email, financial, and social media services have this option, though many casual websites do not. If you are likely to lose your phone, you may be locked out of your account when you cannot generate or receive a token. Take this into consideration when deciding whether to enable Two-Factor Authentication, though many sites offer "back-up token" for this scenario.</p>
							<h2>Apps</h2>
							<p>Many websites will simply text you a Two-Factor Authentication token when you log-in. While this is an easy approach, it depends on both having control of your phone and being able to receive texts. You could be locked out of your accounts when cell reception is poor, or if you lose your phone. By using a specialized Two-Factor Authentication app, you can generate Two-Factor Authentication codes from multiple devices: your desktop, your tablet, or your phone. The app <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.authy.com/app/mobile/">Authy</a></b> is free and simple to use—it seamlessly integrates with Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and many other popular websites. It automatically syncs between your devices, so you can switch whenever you need to. And it works offline—even if you don't have internet access on your device, you can still generate Two-Factor Authentication tokens.</p>
