							<h1 class="major">My partner has unwanted access to my online accounts.</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>We have a wide range of identities online. Our email accounts allow us to communicate professionally with coworkers, while our social media accounts let us connect with friends and family across the world. Bank accounts provide a snapshot of our financial resources, while shopping accounts let us spend our money as we see fit. <b>Across dozens of online accounts, we shape our lives to satisfy our needs and desires.</b></p>
							<p>Many controlling partners demand access to their partner's online accounts. They may believe that the openness of sharing accounts is part of a healthy relationship. Others may be suspicious or insecure, wanting to see who their partner communicates with online. An exploitative partner might use their partner's account to take advantage of their financial resources, shopping with their credit card or transferring money between bank accounts. Some may want to restrict access to educational or charitable resources, so that their partner is less likely to leave to relationship. Often, a controlling partner may claim that "if you have nothing to hide", you should be okay with giving them access to your accounts.</p>
							<p>Access to online accounts can be given consensually, or taken non-consensually. Sometimes we may give our login information thinking "it's not a big deal", other times we give our information to avoid conflict. Particularly abusive partners may install malicious software on their partner's computer to record passwords secretly.</p>
							<p><b>Everyone has a right to privacy. We all deserve space to choose how we spend our time, money, and attention online.</b> When these activities are monitored or exploited, we lose capacity for self-expression and personal autonomy. Knowing that our bank accounts are being watched may prevent us from buying the clothes we like or books we enjoy. If our social media accounts are not private, we may be less honest and communicative with our loved ones. When a controlling partner says you should "have nothing to hide", they are saying "I do not respect your boundaries". They are saying you do not deserve your own personal space, that they do not trust you, that they are insecure about themselves and the relationship. This does not give them the right to undermine your privacy.</p>
							<p><b>By taking control of your personal accounts, you can assert your independence while ensuring your safety online.</b> We will discuss different strategies for securing your accounts based on your personal levels of safety and comfort.</p>
							<h2>Defense Strategies</h2>
							<p>Securing an online account can be as simple as changing a password. If you suspect your partner of secretly recording your computer activity, you may need to take more involved actions: in this case, we suggest you read our guide <a href="monitoring.html">My partner is monitoring my computer or cell phone activity</a> before following these strategies.</p>
							<h3>Change your passwords</h3>
							<p>To secure an online account, you can change the password to a unique phrase or code only you would know. Simply visit your website and look in your account or settings page for an option to set a new password.</p>
							<p>When setting a new password, try not to use any words or phrases a controlling partner could easily guess. Random combinations of words, like "Purple Dishwasher Potato" are easily remembered and very difficult to guess or hack. It's especially important that you do not re-use a password from another online account. If you want the most secure passwords possible, one option is to use the PASSWORD MANAGER strategy: a password manager generates and stores passwords for you, so you do not have to remember them. This makes it nearly impossible for a partner to guess your password or hack into your account. You can also use the TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION strategy: when you login to an important account, you need a code generated by your phone or received in a text. Even if a partner has your password, they would still need your cell phone in order to access your account.</p>
							<p>Changing a password may upset your partner when they can no longer access your account. Evaluate whether you feel safe enough to take this course of action before doing so.</p>
							<h3>Create backups of your important data</h3>
							<p>A controlling partner may interfere with your online accounts: they might delete emails, erase photos, or unfriend people on social media. If this data is important to you, and you do not feel comfortable taking away access from your partner, you can create backups of your data to the best of your ability. If you use the cloud for backups, and are concerned your partner has access to your cloud as well, make sure you secure your cloud account before saving backup data.</p>
							<p>For emails, you can often set-up a forwarding address so that any email received by your account is saved to another email address too. By creating a new email address, you have a safety net in case your partner obstructs the other email address. You also have options to download emails to your computer. <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5990556/how-can-i-save-all-my-work-emails-for-a-personal-backup">This guide by Lifehacker</a> explores the options available to you, in depth.</p>
							<p>For texts, you can enable text-forwarding, so that all of your texts are saved on another device: possibly a friend or family member's phone. You should be able to go into the settings of your texting app and find the forwarding option. Alternatively, take screenshots of important conversations and save them in a safe place.</p>
							<p>On social media, you often have an option to download your social media history, including posts, messages, and photos. This is available on Facebook and Twitter: go to your account page and look for the option to download your data. Other social media services may not have this option, in which case you should download important photos directly, and take screenshots of conversations you want to save.</p>
							<h3>Create secret accounts</h3>
							<p>When you don't have the option of securing your personal accounts, such as your email account, you can secretly create new accounts that your partner is unaware of.  When you register online, make sure to use a totally new password that your partner would not be able to guess. Also make sure you use an email address and/or login name that your partner is unfamiliar with. If you think your partner may be monitoring your web history, use a private window for the entire browsing session. If you think your partner has installed surveillance software, or may intrude on your web browsing session, consider making your secret accounts on a work or library computer.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>You have a right to use the internet on your own terms. Controlling partners who demand unreasonable access to your online accounts do not respect personal privacy and autonomy. They may seek to control your online behavior or exploit your resources. You can secure your online accounts by using safer passwords and two-factor authentication, backing up important data, or creating secret accounts unavailable to your partner. No matter which strategy works best for you, you are making informed choices about your life, online and off.</p>
							<p>If you're unsure of the right strategy for you, please contact a domestic violence organization for further assistance.</p>
