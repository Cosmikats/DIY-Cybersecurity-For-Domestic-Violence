							<h1 class="major">My sex life is being used against me.</h1>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Sex is inseparable from technology. We excite our partners by sending suggestive sexts throughout the day. We share sexually intimate photographs. We record our sexual encounters with cell phones and cameras. People of all ages and orientations engage with modern technology as a playground of sexual experience. Because sexuality is so easily accessible in our everyday technologies, it can shape our expectations of relationships. Controlling partners are both aroused by the wealth of sexual possibility offered through the internet and galvanized by the opportunities to weaponize sex against their partners.</p>
							<p><b>The difference between electronic sexual intimacy in healthy relationships and coercive relationships is respect and trust.</b> In a healthy relationship, sending nudes or sexts is never an obligation: it is a personal choice. Partners can have safe discussions about what they are comfortable with sending or receiving. If partners want to record their sexual encounters, there is explicit consent between everyone involved. In contrast, controlling and abusive partners may aggressively demand sexual content from their partners. They might argue that it's "normal" in a relationship, or they might "sex shame" their partner for being hesitant. Sometimes, a controlling partner will make veiled threats if their demands are not met: these can include withholding intimacy, cutting off access to loved ones and resources, or forcing unwanted sexual acts. For many partners experiencing abuse, it is safer to comply with sexual demands than risk conflict.</p>
							<p><b>Sexual content such as sexts, nudes, or videos, are incredibly difficult to control once they are made.</b> Screenshots allow intimate materials to be easily duplicated, even if the original is deleted. Social media, forums, and pornography websites readily share sexual content without any consideration for the involved partners. Many people, especially men, see "no big deal" in sharing their partner's sexual media, trading it amongst friends who in turn share it with their friends. <b>The unfortunate reality is that unless you are the sole owner of your sexual content, you cannot force it to stay private.</b> It is only through mutual trust and respect that your privacy can be maintained. And even then, the risk of someone obtaining malicious access to your devices is always present.</p>
							<p>We will explore different scenarios where your private sexual activities may be used against you. It does not matter how or why the sexual content was made. Whether your intimate media was created consensually or it was coerced, you still have a right to privacy.</p>
							<h2>I'm afraid of my sexual content being hacked.</h2>
							<p>When you create a sext, an intimate photograph, or a sexual video, it can live on in a number of places:
							<ul>
							<li>As a file on the device it was created</li>
							<li>In the apps where it is accessed</li>
							<li>In the cloud or a backup solution</li>
							<li>Websites where it is shared</li>
							</ul>
							If you send the sexual content to another person, it can also live on your recipient's devices, apps, cloud, or websites. Even if you delete the content in one location, it may still survive in the other locations. The best approach for protecting sexual content is to be aware of where your content lives, choose apps that give you greater control over your content, and secure your devices and accounts. Depending on your personal safety levels, you can select your best options from the following strategies. Encouraging your partner to these strategies, if they're receptive, can also further reduce risk.</p>
							<h3>Protecting your device</h3>
							<p>Anyone with access to your cell phone or computer can also access your private content. You should use a strong password on your computer and on your cell phone. Our PASSWORD DEFENSE STRATEGY outlines how you can make a stronger password.</p>
							<h3>Protecting your apps</h3>
							<p>When you take a photo or record a video, there are many apps on your phone that can access your content. Be aware of app permissions: if there's an app where you wouldn't want your content to be shared, either delete the content, or disable permissions for the app.</p>
							<p>There is no app that is 100% secure when sharing sexual content. Apps like Snapchat may seem like they are private, but it is incredibly easy for another person to secretly take screenshots or install software to record content. As soon as you send intimate content on an app, you cannot assume that it is secure with the other person, and there is little you can do to prevent the recipient from sharing. If you can, make sure that your recipient is respectful of your privacy and is also taking cybersecurity precautions.</p>
							<p>Regardless of the reasons for sharing sexual content, you can mitigate risk by choosing apps that do not back-up to the cloud, are not shared across devices, and require a password to access. The texting app SIGNAL is a great choice: your messages and photos are encrypted so only you and your recipient can access them. You can configure the app so it requires a password. You can choose to have conversations deleted (though your recipient may preserve the content in some way). Because there is no cloud, you don't have to worry about your account being hacked or leaked. Compared to the standard texting apps, SIGNAL is far more secure, but it is not fool-proof.</p>
							<h3>Protecting your cloud</h3>
							<p>It is very likely that your intimate text messages, photographs, and videos are being automatically backed-up in an online cloud. Deleting them on your device may not guarantee that they are deleted in the cloud. Choosing apps that either do not back-up to the cloud, or have back-ups disabled, is a useful defense against your cloud being compromised. Securing your cloud with a strong password, as described in the PASSWORD DEFENSE STRATEGY, will reduce the risk of a hacker gaining malicious access to your private data. TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION, another one of our defense strategies, further guarantees the security of your cloud.</p>
							<h3>Protecting your websites</h3>
							<p>As soon as you share sexual content on a website, whether it's an email provider, a back-up storage site, a webforum, or a dating website, there is little you can do to guarantee it will not be shared further. You have to trust that the web company won't be hacked, that it's employees are not secretly accessing users' content, and that they won't sell your private data at a later time. On pornography websites, it is notoriously difficult to stop the spread of sexual content, as users and rival pornography websites routinely download and distribute the content.</p>
							<p>You can secure your website account to the best of your ability, which at least prevents a malicious person from easily gaining access to what you shared on the website. The PASSWORD DEFENSE STRATEGY and TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION STRATEGY are, again, your best options. You should also make a point to delete old website accounts if they have sensitive material and you are no longer using them.</p>
							<h2>My partner is sharing pornography of me online</h2>
							<p>There are a significant number of websites dedicated to sharing amateur pornography: rarely is anyone asked whether the involved parties' consented to distribution. Some websites, like "revenge porn" websites, explicitly encourage content that was shared without consent. A controlling or abusive partner may seek these websites to share pornography of you. This practice is highly illegal and immoral, but that is not always a deterrent. A current or ex-partner may share pornography to damage your reputation, to reinforce a sense of a power, to coerce you into contacting them, or because they find it sexually gratifying. Regardless of the reason, it is unacceptable, full-stop.</p>
							<p>It is incredibly difficult to know if your private sexual content has been maliciously shared online. Searching popular pornography websites and forums can be a deeply triggering process, while the sheer number of pornography websites makes it nearly impossible to search them all. It is not your obligation to search for your content on the internet: it is your partner's responsibility not to share that content in the first place.</p>
							<p>If you become aware of your sexual content being shared on a website, The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative offers a <a href="https://www.cybercivilrights.org/online-removal/">very comprehensive guide to removing sexual content from a variety of tech platforms</a>.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>While cell phones and the internet offer an astonishing number of ways to be sexual online, you can take steps to protect your sexts, nudes, and videos from being weaponized against you. Establishing boundaries and trust with a partner is crucial if you feel safe doing so. Securing your electronic devices, apps, cloud, and websites can reduce the risk of someone maliciously accessing your private content. Should your sexual content be shared online without your consent, you can take steps to remove the content from the platforms. While there is no guaranteed way to totally secure your intimate data, you still have an enduring right to privacy.</p>
