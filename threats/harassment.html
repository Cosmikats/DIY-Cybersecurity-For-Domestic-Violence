							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Even after a relationship has ended, an abuser may resort to harassment online to trigger fear in an (ex) partner, assert control, or damage their partner's reputation. The internet, unfortunately, makes it very easy to be subjected to harassment. <b>People of color, women, trans and nonbinary folks, queer folks, muslims, and migrants are frequently targeted for hateful messages, exhaustive arguments, and even threats of violence.</b> Abusers are quick to exploit this vulnerability, either directly harassing their partners on popular online platforms, or enlisting "trolls" to assist in abuse campaigns. In a better world, tech companies would take stronger measures to protect their users from online harassment, unequivocally committing to safer, more caring platforms. Until then, DIY Cybersecurity can serve as a tool of harm-reduction.</p>
							<p>There is no one right way to fight harassment. Based on a personal assessment of your safety, you can decide which protective measures are best for you. Some people may want to make their online platforms "private", while others will want to escalate the issue to the attention of tech providers. In some cases, focusing on support from friends and family may be the best course of action. If your abuser's harassment feels like a crisis that needs direct assistance, and you do not want to contact an emergency resource, you can contact the <b><a href="http://www.crashoverridenetwork.com/index.html">Crash Override Network</a></b>, a "crisis helpline, advocacy group and resource center for people who are experiencing online abuse".</p>
							<p>We will outline common harassment scenarios along with strategies to mitigate the harassment.</p>
							<h2>I'm receiving abusive messages on social media.</h2>
							<p>Sending hurtful or violent messages on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Snapchat is one of the most common forms of harassment available to an abuser. This can significantly damage your ability to enjoy social media: having to cope with intrusive communication from an abuser can be deeply triggering, emotionally exhausting, and frightening.</p>
							<p>Most social media platforms give you the option to make your account private or public. Choosing to be private or public makes you no more deserving of harassment. There are often other security options, such as reporting the abuser through the platform itself. HeartMob, a project to fight online harassment, offers <b><a href="https://iheartmob.org/resources/safety_guides">in-depth guides for how to respond to harassment</a></b> on various social media platforms.</p>
							<p>Abusive messages that threaten violence are criminal. If you feel these threats are an imminent danger, you should contact a Domestic Violence crisis hotline, loved ones who can provide safe shelter, or, if you feel safe doing so, local law enforcement. Collecting evidence of the threats could be important for demonstrating danger to child protective services, court systems, law enforcement, and other state entities who may be involved in the separation from your partner. Because an abuser may choose to delete their harassment, you can take screenshots for your personal records, or report the messages to the tech platform so they have a record.</p>
							<h2>My (ex) partner is impersonating me online.</h2>
							<p>Abusers will often attempt to damage their partner's reputation online as a way to isolate them from friends, coworkers, or family. This impersonation can take the form of using their partner's online accounts to share incriminating photos, send embarrassing messages, or exploit website resources. This data can be true or false: the abuser is more interesting in damage than truth. In other cases, they may sign up for online accounts using your personal information, a form of identity theft.</p>
							<p>If your abuser is using your online accounts to impersonate you, you should read our guide <b><a ref="accounts.html">My partner has unwanted access to my online accounts</a></b>, which details many strategies for securing your accounts and eliminating malicious access.</p>
							<p>Impersonation is frequently accomplished through fake social media accounts, such as a Facebook profile or a Twitter account. It may be tempting to make a social media post "denouncing" the fake profile, but be warned: the more attention a fake profile gets, the more encouraged your abuser will be, and the more likely that it will become detrimental to your online life. Because fake accounts are often brand new accounts, they are less likely to be picked up by search engines, while other social media users are less willing to interact with them. If your platform has the option, report the account as an impersonation and/or as harassment. Having friends report the account may increase the likelihood of response.</p>
							<h2>My personal information is being shared online.</h2>
							<p>Public posting of personal information, also known as "Doxxing", is a very common abusive tactic: phone numbers, addresses, names of family members, embarrassing private details, intimate photographs or texts, and other pieces of personal data can be shared on social media, troll forums, and websites. The sense of exposure can be debilitating. You may fear that your personal life or career will be adversely impacted. You may be forced to worry for your safety, or the safety of your loved ones.</p>
							<p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to prevent the spread of personal information online. Social media platforms are reluctant to get involved beyond just responding to reported posts or users. Websites can only be taken down by legal action. If your platform has the option, report your abuser for harassment. Otherwise, make a point not to give visibility to their activity, and collect evidence in case you need to pursue legal action.</p>
							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
							<p>Online harassment is a constant threat throughout the internet. Abusers can easily take advantage of open social media networks to launch campaigns of abuse, impersonation, and doxxing. While tech platforms should prioritize your well-being online, they are less than willing to seriously combat abuse. To mitigate online harassment to the best of your ability, you can secure your online accounts, report abuse when possible, refuse to give visibility to abusive activity, manage your account's privacy settings, and collect evidence of the abuse. You can also connect with anti-harassment organizations like <b><a href="">Crash Override Network</a></b>, or contact DV organization for assistance. While abusers may seek to control or damage you online, harassment is ultimately a sign of their deep insecurity, frustration, and isolation: you are not responsible for your abuse.</p>
