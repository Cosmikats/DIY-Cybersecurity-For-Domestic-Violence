							<p>The role of technology in healthy relationships is rarely discussed, if ever. Chances are you never had a conversation about personal privacy when you set-up your first cell phone. When you sign up for a new website, you are encouraged to be as open as possible. We become so used to our networks that it can feel uncomfortable being disconnected from people we care about, if only for a moment. We are left with a world of complex technological relationships: When should we text? What should we share? What app should we use?</p>
							<p>If you are trying to control, monitor, or punish your partner using technology, you must commit yourself to being better. This behavior can cause devastating harm to someone you care about. Even if you are well-intentioned, or if your behaviors seem "normal" within your community, your partner's well-being and autonomy must be your priority.</p>
							<p>Have you considered your partner's safety online? Sharing a nude may seem harmless, but it can have devastating consequences for your partner. If private sexual content becomes public, your partner could be subjected to humiliation, online harassment, and repercussions in their education or work. Does your partner have safe spaces where they can privately browse the web, communicate with loved ones, and pursue their hobbies? Without these spaces, your partner's freedom to grow as a person is deeply compromised. It's not a matter of having "something to hide": everyone needs the freedom to be alone. This is how we come to understand our needs, our desires, and our goals without outside pressure. Imagine how you would feel if every thought in your head were broadcasted to the world.</p>
							<p>Think about how you use technology with your partner. Do you find yourself making demands? You may demand your partner share their phone location with you. You may demand regular text messages. You may demand access to their social media. Technology is personal: everyone has a right to use their technology at their own discretion, with respect to the safety of others. Rather than make demands, you have to discuss each other's expectations and come to mutual agreement over what is right for both of you. It is crucial that your partner not feel pressured or coerced. If you feel like you <em>need</em> a certain behavior from your partner, step back and ask yourself why. Often, it is feelings of insecurity, jealousy, or trauma that drive these needs. These are feelings you need to address.</p>
							<p>Patterns of controlling or abusive behavior go beyond technology. If you are reading this guide, you are capable of being better. Consider the following actions, outlined by Lisa Aronson Fontes, a psychiatrist who works in the areas of domestic violence. Rather than pick and choose, you must be willing to address all of them.</p>
							<ul>
							<li>Decide that you really want to change.</li>
							<li>Find your own motivation for changing.</li>
							<li>Do not blame anyone else. You are always responsible for your actions.</li>
							<li>Join a batterer intervention program, even if you've never physically hurt anyone.</li>
							<li>Accept that your partner is fully human.</li>
							<li>Accept that you do not have the right to make every decision.</li>
							<li>Respect your partner's limits.</li>
							<li>Respect your partner's independence.</li>
							<li>Let go of your terror about the relationship ending.</li>
							<li>Choose to act differently.</li>
							<li>Redefine love to require respect and kindness.</li>
							<li>Seek treatment for substance abuse or mental health issues.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Please contact a therapist, a social worker, or a local domestic violence organization to assist you in changing your behaviors. You and your partner will be so much better for it.</p>
