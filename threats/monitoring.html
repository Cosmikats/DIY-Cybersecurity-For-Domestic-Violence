							<span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A Keylogger reads everything you type on your computer. When you enter a password to Gmail? The Keylogger sucks it up. When you arrange dinner plans with a friend? The Keylogger already knows: 6:00pm on Wednesday. You don't see any weird apps on your desktop, but the Keylogger buzzes along in the background, soaking in every letter.</p>
							<p>Your partner can monitor you without technology. Maybe they demand the password to your Facebook account—they claim it's "normal" for couples to share social media, even though it makes you uncomfortable. Or maybe your partner repeatedly asks to see your phone, getting angry when you refuse. "Are you hiding something?" they say, making you feel guilty. Whether they're using surveillance software or simply pressuring you, your partner is saying: "I do not trust you".</p>
							<p>You deserve privacy. It doesn't matter whether you have "something to hide"—choosing when and where to share your personal information is essential for living freely. Privacy allows you to nurture friendships, explore new hobbies, and seek work opportunities without judgement. Being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to forfeit this privacy; a truly loving partner will respect your independence. They will understand your boundaries: what you like sharing (cute cat videos), what you don't like sharing (emails to your parents), what you both agree to keep private (sexts).</p>
							<p>This guide offers simple strategies to assert your privacy. Read them and decide what's best for you. You don't have to take action right away; just being aware of surveillance gives you strength.</p>
							<h2>Red Flags</h2>
							<p>How do you know if your partner is monitoring you? Even programmers have a hard time spotting keyloggers. Unless your partner starts sending Facebook messages, you wouldn't know if they have your password. The following is a list of behaviors that indicate surveillance. It's not an exhaustive list, so above all: trust your gut.</p>
							<ul>
							 <li>Your partner frequently asks to see your computer or cell phone, or takes it.</li>
							 <li>Your partner demands passwords to your computer or cell phone.</li>
							 <li>Your partner wants login information for your email, banking, shopping, or social media accounts.</li>
							 <li>Your partner is known to be "good with computers" and handles your computer tasks.</li>
							 <li>Your partner spends a significant amount of time on their computer and is unusually secretive about it.</li>
							 <li>Your partner makes vague references to activities or conversations they were not present for.</li>
							 <li>Your partner gets unexpectedly angry towards a person you've recently communicated with.</li>
							 <li>Your partner threatens to reveal embarrassing information about you.</li>
							</ul>
							<h2>Defense Strategies</h2>
							<p>Computers and cell phones are super complicated. It's intimidating to download unfamiliar software or change new settings in an app. You might also be afraid of your partner catching you. Don't worry, it's okay to feel this way. Read these strategies at your own pace.</p>
							<h3>Change your passwords</h3>
							<p>If you think your partner is reading your texts, watching your emails, looking at your photos, or using your cell phone, you can change your passwords to lock them out. Read our <b><a href="../defense/passwords.html">Secure Your Password Defense Strategy</a></b> for more detailed information.</p>
							<p>Changing passwords depends on your safety levels. Don't change your passwords if there's a risk of your partner retaliating violently. You may not know whether your partner has your passwords—try changing one password and wait a few days to see if your partner reacts. If they don't react, try changing another password and repeat the process.</p>
							<p>Cybersecurity is a great excuse for changing passwords. Should your partner notice your new passwords, you can say that you're worried about being hacked. Hacking is very common in the news, so pointing to a recent hacking story may help. You can also say that you're interested in cybersecurity because of the NSA (the National Security Agency, whose leaks in 2013 revealed mass government surveillance. Under Trump, this is a very valid reason for cybersecurity).</p>
							<p>If you are separated from your partner, change all of your important passwords just to be safe. One option is to use the use a <b>Password Manager</b>. A password manager generates and stores passwords for you, so you don't have to remember them. This makes it impossible for your partner to guess your password or hack into your account. You can also use <b>Two-Factor Authentication</b>. When you login to a website, you will need a code generated by your phone or received in a text. Even if your partner has your password, they would still need your cell phone in to access your website.</p>
							<h3>Protect your computer web browsing</h3>
							<p>Web browsers store every website you visit in their "history". Your partner can check this history to see which websites you've visited and when. Web browsers also store "cookies", pieces of data used by websites to store login information, website settings, or advertising data. Cookies let you return to websites and still be logged in. Though it might be inconvenient, log out of your websites when you're done using them. That way, your partner can't use your account. Alternatively, you can customize your web browser to delete your activity for you. Our <b><a href="../defense/web-browsers">Private Web Browsing Defense Strategy</a></b> explains in-depth how you protect your web browsing automatically or on a case-by-case basis.
							<h3>Protect your cell phone apps</h3>
							<p>Once you log into an app, you usually stay logged in. Make sure to logout of apps you don't want your partner using. Having a numeric password on the cell phone helps too.</p>
							<p>It's possible to download malicious apps that monitor other apps. Delete any apps that you have not personally downloaded. For the apps you do use, check the app permissions. Data such as location or photos can unknowingly reveal very personal information. Disable access to photos, cameras, location, microphones, and other apps unless they're absolutely necessary. For example, it makes sense for a photo app to have access to a camera. A calendar app that asks for location? Not as important.</p>
							<p>Lots of apps store your data in "the cloud", which means it's backed up somewhere. Read <b><a href="">My partner has unwanted access to my online accounts.</a></b>  if you think your partner has access to your cloud.</p>
							<p>If you're not comfortable changing your phone, use your apps more secretly. In Safari and Chrome, browse in a "Private Window" or "Incognito Window", which will not record your browsing history. In your texting apps, feel free to delete conversations (though you can only delete the entire conversation). For phone calls, delete call history. For contacts, use fake names when you store a phone number. Close apps when you're not using them, so that they don't record your activity.</p>
							<h3>Install Malware Protection</h3>
							<p>Malware is malicious software installed without your consent. Keylogging is particularly evil malware, recording all the keyboard strokes on your computer. There's also malware can track your web browsing or email application. Privacy controls, usually meant for kids, can act like malware, watching your activity.</p>
							<p>Because there are so many kinds of malware, it's difficult to detect them. The best security strategy is to INSTALL MALWARE PROTECTION. This program will scan your computer and alert you to suspicious programs. You can choose to delete them or leave them be. Malware protection is not 100% accurate, so even if it doesn't find malware, there's no guarantee that your computer is safe. It's also not very useful for cell phones, in which case you should just delete unfamiliar apps or refresh the OS (we explain this below).</p>
							<p>Malware protection is very common, especially on Windows computers, so if your partner is suspicious, say you're protecting against viruses. You can also delete the malware protection after you've used it.</p>
							<h3>Refresh your operating system</h3>
							<p>Sometimes it's easiest to just refresh your cell phone or computer. All of your applications, data, and settings will be erased. That way, you know there is no malware installed. Every operating system has a different way of refreshing, so here are instructions for Mac OS and Windows.</p>
							<p>~INSERT LINKS HERE~</p>
							<p>When you refresh your device, back-up your important data in the cloud or on an external hard-drive. Read <b><a href="">My partner has unwanted access to my online accounts.</a></b>  if you think your partner has access to your cloud.</p>
							<h3>Use a work computer, a library computer, or buy a secret computer/cell phone</h3>
							<p>Work computers are super secure when your partner doesn't have access to your office. Not to mention, it's your IT Department's job to prevent malware. Using your work computer for sensitive activity, like researching domestic violence resources, is a great option.</p>
							<p>Libraries are equipped with public computers and helpful librarians. Visiting a library tends not to be very suspicious; they're also free, acessible, and generally within driving distance. Many librarians would happily assist you with anything internet-related.</p>
							<p>Consider buying a "secret" laptop or phone, but only if you feel safe hiding things from your partner. You could use these devices for anything that'd be dangerous on your normal devices.</p>
							<h3>Create secret accounts</h3>
							<p>You can always create new accounts that your partner is unaware of.  When you register, create a totally new password that your partner would not be able to guess. Use an email address and/or login name that your partner is unfamiliar with. Browse with a private window for the entire process. You can also make your secret accounts on a work or library computer.</p>
